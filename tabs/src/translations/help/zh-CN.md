<div><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pjoLEtiFf2A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

## <a name='Registrationandlogin'></a>注册和登录

### <a name='HowdoIregisterforCboard'></a>如何注册Cboard？

注册板，请先跟随欢迎页面上的步骤，您可以在这里找到登录选择。

![棋盘网站](/images/help/website.png "Cboard website")

![欢迎页面](/images/help/welcome-page.png "Welcome page")

如果您是新用户，请按 SIGN UP 一个简短的表单将弹出要求获取基本信息以创建您的帐户。

![板块注册](/images/help/signup.png "Cboard signup")

一旦您填写了此信息，您将在收到一封电子邮件之后不久收到一个链接以便确认您的帐户。

![Email signup](/images/help/signupemail.png "Email signup")

This information is only held by the company to support use of Cboard and offer help when necessary. It is not shared with other organizations, (See [Privacy details](https://www.cboard.io/privacy/)).

一旦您验证了您的帐户，您将可以访问Cboard，并将收到另一封确认您已成功验证您的帐户的电子邮件。

### <a name='CanIregistermyselfusingmysocialmediaaccounts'></a>我可以使用自己的社交媒体帐户进行注册吗？

Yes! On the login page, you will be given the option to sign up with your Google or Facebook account if you wish to do so. You can also register with an e-mail address.

### <a name='HowdoIlogintoCboardonceIamaregistereduser'></a>我是注册用户后如何登录Cboard？

To log in to Cboard, you follow the first step used to sign up, but instead of selecting SIGN UP on the Welcome screen, select LOGIN. You will then be asked to provide the e-mail you initially signed up with, and the password you set up.

![棋盘登录](/images/help/login.png "Cboard login")

### 配置板的不同选项是什么？

Once you login to Cboard, you can access different options to configure and develop the Communication Board provided when Cboard is in unlocked mode. See the list of all the key options below:

![棋盘设置](/images/help/settings.png "Cboard settings")

### <a name='HowdoIlogout'></a>如何注销？

You can log out by selecting the settings icon, and the option will appear in red. You can also select the lock symbol on the right corner, click three times and once you unlocked the screen and the red bar appears, select the icon to the left of the lock (your picture if you have one loaded) and the option to log out will appear in red.

![棋盘注销](/images/help/logout.png "Cboard logout")

### <a name='Whatisthedifferencebetweenaregisteredandanon-registereduser'></a>注册用户和未注册用户之间有什么区别？

A registered user is able to personalize their boards, and the changes made will be saved to their account so that when they log back in, they can use their customized boards. A non-registered user won't be able to save changes safely. We recommend registering just in case, so your changes are guaranteed to be saved.

### <a name='HowdoIupdatemyuserinformation'></a>如何更新我的用户信息？

To update your user information, follow the same steps you would use if you were trying to log out. Select the lock symbol on the top right corner of the board – three clicks or taps, and once you unlock the screen, select the icon to the left of the lock (user name initials, photo), and you can then edit your user information.

### <a name='HowdoIresetmypassword'></a>如何重置我的密码？

为了重置您的密码，请发送电子邮件support@cboard.io，我们会回复您。

## <a name='Price'></a>价钱

### <a name='HowmuchdoesCboardcost'></a>棋盘花费多少？

棋盘完全免费。

## <a name='Features'></a>特征

### <a name='WhatdevicesandOSaresupported'></a>支持哪些设备和操作系统？

Cboard is available online using a wide variety of devices, including desktops, tablets and mobile phones using Mac, Windows and Android operating systems. It is best viewed in browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari and an Android app is available from Google Play.

![浏览器支持](/images/help/browsers.png "Browser support")

Because Cboard is a web based app it will respond to the settings provided by the individual browsers. This may mean you have different results to the settings provided by Cboard. For example you may find different speech options being offered.

别忘了您也可以根据计算机、平板电脑或电话屏幕大小使用浏览器放大或缩放。

请询问板如何为那些有视觉障碍的人使用高对比度模式，因为在使用这种类型的网页应用时，基于浏览器的选项是没有帮助的。

### <a name='WhichlanguagesaresupportedbyCboard'></a>板支持哪种语言？

Cboard comes with support for 33 languages. To select a different language go to SETTINGS – select LANGUAGE and those available will appear. Make a choice and a ‘tick’ will appear beside the language.

<div><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HHq9b3dJ0zM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

### <a name='CanCboardreadmymessageoutaloud'></a>板是否可以朗读我的消息？

Yes, Cboard uses the synthetic speech output available on your device to read out individual labels found below each symbol as they are added to the message output box. You can select a complete message and it will also be read aloud. If a personalised recording of a sound, word or phrase has been added to a symbol (instructions under Talking – Voice Recordings) you will hear that recording instead of the synthesised voice. This can be very helpful where a translation is not available in a language, a child’s voice is needed or an accent is unacceptable. Please ensure web access has been given to your microphone.

### <a name='Speechcapabilities'></a>语音能力

In order to adjust speech capabilities, go into SETTINGS, and under the LANGUAGE category is the SPEECH category. When you select SPEECH, you will be able to edit the pitch and pace of speech on Cboard.

![语音能力](/images/help/speech.png "Speech capabilities")

### <a name='Exportandimport'></a>出口和进口

Both options to export are within SETTINGS in the SYSTEM category, below Language and Speech. The EXPORT category will give you the option to upload either an OpenBoard or PDF. The IMPORT category will open your saved files once you select RESTORE.

![导出能力](/images/help/export.png "Export capabilities")

### <a name='Displaycapabilities'></a>显示能力

Display settings can be edited in SETTINGS, within the SYSTEM category. The Display option is right below Export and Import. One you select DISPLAY, you can change the UI size as well as the app Font size by selecting the size you want. The red dot should be under the size you want to choose.

![显示能力](/images/help/display.png "Display capabilities")

### <a name='CanIchangeanynavigationsettings'></a>我可以更改任何导航设置吗？

Use the NAVIGATION section to edit and facilitate the way you use to move around Cboard and delete symbols in the message box. Navigation at the end of the SYSTEM Category in SETTINGS allows you to have a larger ‘back’ button that is easier to select. It is also possible to allow a delete (‘x’) button to appear above each symbol as they are presented within the message box. This can make it easier to delete symbols within a sentence. But be aware of user needs as it can also confuse some individuals.

### <a name='Navigationthroughtheinterface'></a>通过接口导航

In order to edit and facilitate navigating through Cboard, select NAVIGATION, the last menu item within SYSTEM (all in Settings) allows you to add certain details to make using the board easier. The first option within Navigation allows a larger ‘back’ button that is easier to select because of the size. The second adds an ‘x’ button to make it easier to delete symbols, and the third makes it easier to unlock by requiring only one click to unlock settings.

![导航能力](/images/help/navigation.png "Navigation capabilities")

## <a name='Settings'></a>设置

### <a name='HowdoIaccesssettingsinCboard'></a>如何访问板上的设置？

![全屏功能](/images/help/fullscreen.png "Fullscreen")

### <a name='HowdoIshareaboard'></a>如何共享板？

若要分享一个板，请按右手边的锁符号，然后按最高行(黑条)，解锁屏幕。 右侧的第三个符号让您可以选择在任何电子邮件上分享您的棋盘， Facebook，Twitter，或复制要发送给某人的链接。

## <a name='BoardEditing'></a>董事会编辑

### <a name='HowdoIcreateanemptyboard'></a>如何创建一个空看板？

在棋盘中，空板等于一个文件夹。

如果你想要创建一个新的或空的看板，你必须创建一个新的目录， 并且这将在 Cboard 存储区域创建一个新的棋盘(您可以看到您在编辑模式下在中间条上进入BOARDS的时间)。

新的空棋盘将立即用于编辑，可以设置为根板 (使用构建按钮)， 这意味着它将是你下次打开棋盘时看到的第一个棋盘。

To create a new folder, begin by unlocking the screen selecting the lock button on the right hand side.

You will then be given the option to add a Tile / BUTTON which is the first and automatic option or select the FOLDER This action makes a NEW BOARD to which you can add more tiles and folders.

This new folder will automatically link to a board above it (if included a row of tiles). It will appear in your list of boards as an empty board until it is populated with symbols and labels.

### <a name='CanIchangetheorderingoftheelementsinaboard'></a>我可以更改板上元素的顺序吗？

Yes! When you are editing a board, unlock the screen using the LOCK symbol. Then select the EDIT block icon on the left hand side (below the BUILD icon). You can then drag the pictogram/symbol or folder to wherever you want to put it within the same board.

![通讯板](/images/help/communicatorBoards.png "Communicator boards")

### <a name='PublicBoards'></a>公共板
